The original code file is "deconvolution.py".

This code has 3 sliders (Angle, d, SNR) to adjust motion deblurring.
Also, motion deblurring is set to "linear" by default,
which can be changed to "circular" by pressing space bar key.
However, Linear is OK. No need to change that.

Input image can be changed from line 72.

For "eyantra.jpg" file, the appropriate values of sliders are:-
Angle = 90 degree
    d = 20
  SNR = 25 dB
(As found by the hit and trial method)
=========================================================================

My progress of shortening this code and hardcoding the 3 values
is the code written in "deconvolution - modified.py"
